# An Exploration of Neural Network Image Colorization and Processing Techniques

## Abstract

This is an exploration and comparison of different approaches to achieve automatic colorization of an uncolored image (usually a drawn black-and-white sketch) via the use of computer learning algorithms and processes. Traditionally, the coloring of a drawing has been a manual process, involving conscious decisions on behalf of the artist undertaking the task. Such things as color schemes, lighting layouts and textures have been the result of manual, intentional choices made by the human colorer. However, with the advent of advanced computer learning techniques like convolutional neural networks, these decisions can now be made by computers. Furthermore, by training neural networks on examples of art, it is possible to produce an entire colorized image with limited-to-no input from human controllers. We intend to explore and compare the workings of several implementations of computer image colorization, including observing how different training datasets affect their results. We also will explore some other ways in which computer learning and neural networks may be used to assist in creating art.
